Pyku
====

Docker container for running a Pyku server.  Pyku is a python script I wrote to randomly generate haikus from the american-english dictionary included in most Linux distributions.

##Building and Running##

This is a [Docker](http://docker.io) container image.  You need to have Docker installed to build and run the container.

To build the image, change directories into the root of this repository, and run:

`docker build -t pyku .`  <-- note the period on the end

Once it finishes building, you can run the container with:

`docker run -i -t -d -p 8080:80 pyku`

Then, open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to see your randomly generated haiku.

To improve startup speed, this image will not update with the latest version of the Pyku software automatically once the initial image is built.  When a new update is released, run the `docker build` command from above to get the newest version.
